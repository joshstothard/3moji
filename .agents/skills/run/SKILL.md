# Run — Launch and verify the app

Use this skill whenever you need to start the app and visually verify a UI change.

---

## Step 1 — Read the actual ports

**This step is mandatory. Never skip it. Never assume a port.**

Read ports from the env files before doing anything else:

```bash
grep -E "^PORT=" apps/web/.env 2>/dev/null || echo "PORT=3000"   # web port  (default 3000)
```

- If `apps/web/.env` is missing, copy `apps/web/.env.example` → `apps/web/.env.local` and fill in the required values, then re-read.
- `WEB_PORT` = `PORT` value from `apps/web/.env` if present; otherwise default to `3000`.

**Every URL constructed in subsequent steps must use these values.** Using any other port is wrong.

---

## Step 2 — Check if servers are already running

Check both independently:

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:<WEB_PORT>/
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:<API_PORT>/healthz
```

Interpret the result as follows:

- **`000`** — connection refused; the server is not running.
- **Any other code (200, 302, 401, 404, 503, etc.)** — TCP connection succeeded; the server is up.

- **Both up** → skip to Step 5.
- **One or both down** → proceed to Step 3.

Do **not** loop or sleep-poll. One check only. If not ready, say so and let the user know to try again in ~10 s.

---

## Step 3 — Start the dev servers (only if not running)

First check that dependencies are installed:

```bash
# If node_modules is absent or turbo binary is missing, install first
test -f node_modules/.bin/turbo || npm install
```

On **Windows**, run the command in PowerShell rather than Bash. Bash on Windows does not resolve local `node_modules/.bin` binaries, so `next` and `nest` will fail with "not recognized":

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Use the current runtime's background-process option so the agent does not hang indefinitely. Then do a **single** readiness check after a short wait (~15 s). If still not responding, report it and stop — do not loop.

---

## Step 4 — Verify Playwright MCP is available

Before navigating, confirm that the current runtime exposes tools from the `playwright` MCP server.

- Claude Code and GitHub Copilot CLI use the root `.mcp.json`.
- Codex uses `.codex/config.toml`.
- GitHub Copilot coding agent provides its built-in Playwright MCP server.

If the server is disconnected, unapproved, or missing, report that exact setup problem before continuing.

---

## Step 5 — Navigate to the app

Use the Playwright MCP `browser_navigate` tool exposed by the current runtime to open the app:

```
url: http://localhost:<WEB_PORT>/
```

Then use its `browser_take_screenshot` tool to confirm the page rendered:

```
type: png
filename: screenshot.png
```

Read the saved screenshot from the absolute project root path to visually verify it is not blank.

---

## Step 6 — Handle authentication (if applicable)

If the app redirects to a login page, check `apps/web/.env` for test credentials:

```bash
grep -E "^(TEST_USER|TEST_EMAIL|TEST_USERNAME|E2E_USERNAME)=" apps/web/.env
grep -E "^(TEST_PASSWORD|TEST_PASS|E2E_PASSWORD)=" apps/web/.env
```

Fill in the credentials and submit. Wait for the redirect to the main app before continuing.

If no auth is configured, skip this step.

---

## Step 7 — Drive the app

Navigate, click, and inspect as needed for the verification task. Key routes for this template:

| Route | What it shows       |
| ----- | ------------------- |
| `/`   | Landing / home page |

Adjust routes to match the feature under test.

---

## Step 8 — Screenshots and snapshots

- **Screenshots** are saved to the **project root** (e.g. `./screenshot.png`). Read them from the absolute path.
- Use snapshots (accessibility tree / DOM snapshot) to locate element references before clicking.
- Use screenshots for visual before/after comparisons.

---

## Notes

- Next.js dev server starts on port 3000 by default. Override with `PORT=` in `apps/web/.env`.
- `npm run dev` at the repo root uses Turborepo and starts `apps/web`. There is no separate backend process: route handlers and server actions are the backend ([ADR-0006](../../../docs/adr/0006-nextjs-on-vercel-is-the-whole-application.md)).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (see `.nvmrc` for version)
- The GitHub CLI (`gh`), authenticated with the `project` scope — see [GitHub CLI and the project board](#github-cli-and-the-project-board) below.
- Bash — the hooks in `scripts/hooks/` and the parity check shell out to it. On Windows, Git Bash (bundled with Git for Windows) supplies it, but **installing Git is not enough — see below.**
- On Windows only: `bash` must resolve to Git Bash, not the WSL launcher. See below.
- On Windows only: symlink support enabled, so `.claude/skills` materialises as a link. See below.

### Windows: `bash` must resolve to Git Bash

Git for Windows puts `C:\Program Files\Git\cmd` on `PATH`, and that directory contains **no `bash.exe`** — the binary lives in `C:\Program Files\Git\bin`, which the installer does not add. With `Git\bin` absent, a bare `bash` resolves to `C:\Windows\System32\bash.exe`: the **WSL launcher**. Unless you have a WSL distro with a `/bin/bash`, it exits 1 with:

```
<3>WSL (9 - Relay) ERROR: CreateProcessCommon:798: execvpe(/bin/bash) failed: No such file or directory
```

Copilot CLI runs each hook's `bash` command through whatever `bash` is on `PATH`, and **its hooks are fail-closed**. So this one missing `PATH` entry denies _every_ tool call in the session — including `ask_user`, which is what makes it unrecoverable from inside the agent: it cannot even ask you for help, let alone repair the hook. The symptom is `Denied by preToolUse hook … (hook errored)` on everything; the cause is invisible unless you read `~/.copilot/logs/process-*.log`.

Fix it by putting `C:\Program Files\Git\bin` **before** `C:\Windows\system32` in the **Machine** `PATH`. It must be the Machine list, not the User list: Windows composes a process `PATH` as Machine-then-User, so a User entry still loses to `System32`. From an **elevated** PowerShell 7:

```powershell
$parts = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('Path','Machine') -split ';' |
    Where-Object { $_ -ne '' -and $_.TrimEnd('\') -ne 'C:\Program Files\Git\bin' }
$i = [Array]::FindIndex($parts, [Predicate[string]] { $args[0].TrimEnd('\') -imatch '^[A-Za-z]:\\WINDOWS\\system32$' })
if ($i -lt 0) { throw "C:\Windows\System32 not found in the Machine PATH — aborting rather than writing a guessed PATH." }
$prefix = if ($i -gt 0) { $parts[0..($i - 1)] } else { @() }
$new = $prefix + 'C:\Program Files\Git\bin' + $parts[$i..($parts.Count - 1)]
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('Path', ($new -join ';'), 'Machine')
```

Then **sign out and back in, or reboot.** Restarting the editor is not enough, and neither is killing `explorer.exe` — Explorer is relaunched with the logon session's cached environment block, so everything it starts inherits the stale `PATH`. Verify with `(Get-Command bash).Source`, which must print `C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe`.

This is a workstation fix, not a repo fix: the hook command string cannot help, because Copilot has already resolved `bash` before the string runs.

### Windows: the `.claude/skills` link

`.claude/skills` is committed as a symlink to the canonical `.agents/skills` tree. That is deliberate: every agent reads the same skill files, so there is one copy to edit and no way for the trees to drift. Windows needs a little setup to honour it. Git on Windows defaults to `core.symlinks=false`, and in that state checkout writes a **17-byte text file** containing the link target instead of a link. The agent then finds **zero skills**, and `npm run verify:agents` fails with `.claude/skills must be a link to .agents/skills`.

**The easiest fix is `npm install`.** The root `prepare` script runs `scripts/setup-links.sh`, which repairs the link the same way it installs the git hooks. It is idempotent — when the link already resolves to the canonical tree it exits without touching anything — and it never fails the install: if it cannot repair the link it warns loudly and prints the manual fix instead.

As a side effect of repairing, it sets `core.symlinks=true` **in this clone only** (local config, reversible with `git config --unset core.symlinks`). It is never reached when the link is already healthy.

If you would rather do it by hand:

```bash
# Requires Windows Developer Mode (Settings -> Privacy & security -> For developers)
git config core.symlinks true
rm -f .claude/skills && git checkout -- .claude/skills
```

Verify it took:

```bash
git ls-files -s .claude/skills   # mode must be 120000
readlink -f .claude/skills       # must land inside THIS clone
npm run verify:agents
```

The `readlink` check is the one that matters. A link that merely _resolves_ is not proof of health: if the committed target is ever an absolute path, it resolves perfectly in every other clone — straight into the original clone's skill tree. Nothing errors; agents silently read another checkout's skills. The committed target must stay the relative `../.agents/skills`.

#### The junction fallback

If Developer Mode is unavailable — some managed devices block it — create a directory junction instead, which needs no elevation:

```cmd
rmdir .claude\skills 2>nul & del .claude\skills 2>nul
mklink /J .claude\skills "%CD%\.agents\skills"
```

Run that from the repository root. `mklink /J` resolves a relative target against the
current directory rather than the link's parent, so a relative `..\.agents\skills`
produces a link that exists but points nowhere — hence the absolute `%CD%` form.

> [!WARNING]
> **Never run `git checkout -- .claude/skills` while a junction is in place.** It deletes your skills. Git clears the path before writing the symlink, and it recurses **through** the junction to do it — so it empties the real `.agents/skills` directory. Reproduced from a clean repository: four files in the target before, zero after. `rm -f` on a junction is safe; it is specifically git's path-clearing that recurses.
>
> Remove the junction first (`rmdir .claude\skills`, or `cmd /c rmdir` from Git Bash — **not** `rm -rf`, which recurses the same way), then let git write the link. `scripts/setup-links.sh` does exactly this, and bails out early when a healthy junction is already in place.

The parity check accepts a junction: it records an absolute target rather than the relative `../.agents/skills`, so the check verifies that the path resolves to the canonical tree rather than string-matching the target. Do not replace the link with a copied directory — the two trees would drift and nothing would catch it.

### Git worktrees and `.env`

`.env` is gitignored, so a freshly created worktree does not have one. That is now harmless for the workflow skills: they reach GitHub through `gh`, whose credentials live in your user profile, not in the repository, so every worktree can already talk to your issues and board.

`.env` is **optional**. Create one only for:

- `GH_PROJECT_OWNER` / `GH_PROJECT_NUMBER` — needed only when more than one GitHub Project is linked to the repository and `scripts/gh-workflow.mjs` must be told which board to use.
- Application environment variables your apps read locally.

If you do keep one, `.worktreeinclude` at the repo root copies it into new worktrees for tools that honour the convention — Claude Code copies the listed files at creation time. **GitHub Copilot CLI does not honour `.worktreeinclude`** (verified against 1.0.80), so copy it in by hand there.

Note that `.claude/settings.json` hooks already resolve the repo root with
`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, which is worktree-correct, and `scripts/verify.sh` needs no
credentials — so verification and the git hooks work in a worktree regardless.

## Coding Agent Setup

Use Claude Code, Codex, or GitHub Copilot CLI. All three read `AGENTS.md` and the canonical skills in `.agents/skills/` through their repository adapters.

Install the runtime you intend to use from its current vendor documentation. Then confirm its repository configuration:

- Claude Code: `CLAUDE.md` imports `AGENTS.md`, and `.claude/skills` resolves to `.agents/skills`.
- Codex: `.codex/config.toml`, `.codex/hooks.json`, and `.codex/agents/` are detected.

### Codex: trusting the repository hooks

**Codex will not run this repository's hooks until you approve them, and it does not warn you that it isn't.**

**Trusting the folder is not the same as trusting the hooks.** The prompt Codex shows the first time you open a directory grants _folder_ trust and is recorded under `[projects."<path>"] trust_level`. Hook approval is a separate record under `[hooks.state."…"]`. A repository can be fully trusted as a folder while every one of its hooks is still skipped, which is the state most people land in — folder trust is the prompt you remember answering.

Check both:

```bash
grep -A1 '\[projects."'"$PWD"'"\]' ~/.codex/config.toml   # folder trust
grep -c "$PWD/.codex/hooks.json" ~/.codex/config.toml        # hook trust: 0 means none
```

Codex stores consent per hook handler as a `trusted_hash` under `[hooks.state."…"]` in `$CODEX_HOME/config.toml` (default `~/.codex/config.toml`), keyed by the absolute path of `.codex/hooks.json`. A handler runs only when its status is `Managed` or `Trusted`. Until then it is `Untrusted` and skipped — so the PreToolUse safety policy blocks nothing, the PostToolUse formatter never runs, and the Stop docs reminder never fires. A session still prints `hook:` lines for any hooks you have trusted globally, which makes the gap easy to miss.

Approve them once per machine, per clone:

```bash
codex
```

Run it interactively in the repository root and approve the hooks when Codex asks you to review them. Then confirm:

```bash
npm run verify:codex-hooks
```

That check is part of `scripts/verify.sh`. It fails and names each handler that has never been trusted, and it skips cleanly when Codex is not installed.

> **Editing `.codex/hooks.json` revokes trust.** The hash covers each handler's normalised config, so any change flips it to `Modified` and Codex stops running it until you review the hooks again. Re-run `codex` interactively after touching that file. `verify:codex-hooks` cannot detect this case — it cannot recompute Codex's hash — so treat a hooks edit as requiring a re-approval.

For automation that already vets the hook source, `codex exec --dangerously-bypass-hook-trust …` runs enabled hooks without persisted trust for that invocation. It is not a substitute for reviewing them on a workstation.

- GitHub Copilot CLI: `.github/hooks/`, `.github/agents/`, and `.agents/skills/` are detected. Do not create a repo `.copilot` folder.

  Each handler resolves its script as `${COPILOT_PROJECT_DIR:-$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)}/scripts/hooks/…`. `COPILOT_PROJECT_DIR` is the workspace root Copilot exports into every hook process; the Git root is only a fallback. Prefer the variable, because Copilot loads repo hooks from **two** sources — the `.github/hooks/*.json` file and a second one it labels `"repo settings"` — and the second runs with no working directory. There, `git rev-parse` fails, `$(…)` expands to empty, and the command degrades to a bare `/scripts/hooks/pre-tool-use.js` that Node resolves against the filesystem root (`C:\scripts\hooks\pre-tool-use.js` on Windows).

  Note `COPILOT_WORKSPACE_PATH` is **not** set — an earlier fix keyed on that name and silently fell through to the same failing `git rev-parse`. Confirm any replacement by dumping `env` from inside a hook rather than assuming a variable exists.

  Each handler then checks the resolved script is present and **fails open** if it is not: PreToolUse emits a diagnostic on stderr plus an `ask` decision, and PostToolUse and AgentStop skip their advisory work. Copilot's own behaviour is fail-closed — a non-zero hook denies the tool call — so without this guard an unresolvable root denies every call in the session, `ask_user` included, and the agent cannot report or repair the problem. `scripts/verify-agent-workflow.mjs` covers both paths: the hook must enforce policy when started outside the repository with `COPILOT_PROJECT_DIR` set, and must return `ask` rather than exit non-zero when the root cannot be resolved at all.

  Why the `"repo settings"` copy runs an older, unguarded command isn't confirmed — triage only established that it's independent of local file edits, not why. One hypothesis is that it's fetched from the remote default branch, in which case a fix to the hook command only takes effect there once it merges; treat that as unconfirmed until someone traces it further.

Confirm that the `playwright` MCP server is available before visual work. Claude Code and Copilot CLI use `.mcp.json`; Codex uses `.codex/config.toml`; GitHub Copilot coding agent provides Playwright in its hosted environment.

GitHub Copilot CLI keeps repository hooks and workspace MCP servers off in an untrusted non-interactive `-p` session. Opt into both for that process when the folder has not already been trusted:

```bash
GITHUB_COPILOT_PROMPT_MODE_REPO_HOOKS=true \
GITHUB_COPILOT_PROMPT_MODE_WORKSPACE_MCP=true \
copilot -p "your prompt"
```

### GitHub CLI and the project board

Work is tracked in GitHub Issues on a GitHub Project board, and every skill that touches the tracker goes through `scripts/gh-workflow.mjs`. Set it up once per machine:

```bash
gh auth login                           # sign in to GitHub
gh auth refresh -s project              # allow gh to manage Project boards
node scripts/gh-workflow.mjs setup      # create + link the board, set columns, create labels (idempotent)
node scripts/gh-workflow.mjs doctor     # confirm everything is ready
```

No `.env` values are required. See [github-workflow.md](github-workflow.md) for the board statuses, labels, and helper commands.

### Environment variables

`.env` is optional (see [Git worktrees and `.env`](#git-worktrees-and-env) above). To create one:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

The optional variables are documented inline in `.env.example`.

### Starting an issue

Invoke the `pickup` skill with the issue number, e.g. `42`. Claude Code and GitHub Copilot CLI use `/pickup 42`; Codex uses `$pickup 42`.

The agent assigns the issue to you, moves it to **In Progress** on the board, creates the branch, implements the work, runs verification, and raises the PR.

> **Important:** Make sure the issue is complete before pointing the agent at it — acceptance criteria defined, relevant designs linked, scope agreed. The agent implements exactly what the issue says. For larger work, plan it first with the `report`, `adr`, `workstream`, and `plan-work` skills — see [github-workflow.md](github-workflow.md) § The planning layer.
